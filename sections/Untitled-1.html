<p><strong>What is your vetting process for your corporate clients?</strong></p>
<p>- 1. Criminal Background Screening</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- 2. Comprehensive Rental Agreement</p>
<p>- 3. Preventative Security Systems </p>
<p>For any third-party platform bookings, every guest must pass a background check, sign a rental agreement, fill out a questionnaire and provide ID.</p>

<p>Regarding our regular corporate clients, these guests are already verified and our corporate client is held liable for the guest.</p>



<p><strong>How do you do your criminal background screening?</strong></p>
<p>Upon making a reservation<span> </span><span>Esocidae </span>automatically sends an email requiring the guest to verify their identity and submit their information for a criminal background screen.</p>
<p>The link provided takes them to<span> </span><span>Esocidae'</span>s criminal screening tool, TransUnion Smart Move.</p>
<p>The guest is asked for their full legal name, previous address, social security number, and date of birth.</p>
<p>A criminal background report is sent securely to<span> </span><span>Esocidae </span>where our Trust &amp; Safety Manager analyzes the results and makes a decision based on<span> </span><span>Esocidae</span>’s screening policy.</p>
<p>We do not accept severe criminal convictions and sex offenses including but not limited to murder, terrorism, rape, assault, battery and child abuse.</p>
<p>Our screening checks the OFAC list and public state and country criminal records as well as state and national sex offender registries.</p>
<p>For lesser charges,<span> </span><span>Esocidae</span><span>’s </span>screening policy takes several factors into account, such as the severity of the charge, when the charge was placed, and the type of offense.</p>
<p><strong>How is a Criminal Background Screening Performed when Booked on Other Platforms?</strong></p>
<p>All of our listings on Airbnb and VRBO require the guest to be ID-verified with a satisfactory background screening. Airbnb’s verification process checks multiple facets of a guest’s identity:</p>
<p>● A guest’s first and last name and date of birth</p>
<p>● For United States residents, certain databases of public state and county criminal records are checked, as well as state and national sex offender registries for criminal convictions and sex offender registrations. For a guest who lives outside the United States, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and to the extent available, they may obtain the local version of background or registered sex offender checks.</p>
<p>● Multiple FCRA-compliant vendors are used to conduct felony conviction checks, national sex offender searches as well as global sanctions reviews including OFAC and terrorist watch lists. These checks cover digitized criminal court records, department of correction records, wanted lists, global watchlist records, and all available state sex offender registries that exist online in the U.S. In addition, they also cover domestic and foreign watch lists and sanction lists, such as domestic and international fugitives, FBI lists (i.e., terrorism, most wanted, white-collar criminals), Interpol, politically exposed persons, U.S. Dept of Treasury lists, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) lists, and many others.</p>

<p><strong>What are your preventative security systems? </strong></p>
